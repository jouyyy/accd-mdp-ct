	<p style=" margin-top:10px;" > This project is about emotional venting, using the characteristics of IFTTT. When users encounter unhappy things, they can immediately get comfort from friends, or digest these emotions by themselves.</p>

	<p>This week we focus on breanstroming on what IFTTT can do and idea collect</p>
	<p>First we brainstormed what interesting reactions and sources the Iftt technology can achieve. At the same time, idea collection was carried out, and finally we drew a simple diagram</p>
	<img src="002.jpeg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="1000" height="400">
	<p>User scenario: When a user browses to a message worth sharing, it will be sent to friends immediately via email. When a friend receives an e-mail, he will give feedback in two ways: "agree" or "disagree".</p>
	<p>If you agree, the picture will be printed on your friend's printer. If you disagree, the picture will be printed on your printer. In this time of social distancing, this is a new way of communication and interaction.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Just like there is common agreement on the scientific nature of color today, it is also known that the human experience of color is a highly complex and subjective phenomenon.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I agree with this statement, because color needs to be pixel-accurate in the eyes of designers. Different colors have different meanings. For example, in our common sense, green is correct, and yellow is a warning color.</p>
	 <blockquote>
		<p>"There is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Because of the development of science and technology, the space for design has become larger and larger, and there are more and more tools that can be used. AR technology can also become less difficult, and designers can easily use tools to create.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“It is important to separate fact from fiction when discussing systematic design principles, and this is especially true for the subject of geometric composition.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I very much agree with this statement that the boundary between reality and virtuality needs to be delineated from the beginning. In this way, it can be designed for different scenarios.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“The bias is still there, because the AI copied it from its training data, but now it’s wrapped in a layer of hard-to-interpret AI behavior.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Algorithm bias has been discussed many times. Before proceeding with algorithm design, I think that programmers need to achieve algorithm justice, solve from the root cause and eliminate the harm caused by the algorithm.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“AI was supposed to learn to identify pictures of skin cancer but learned to identify rulers instead”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Algorithm technology is widely used in medical treatment. From a macro perspective, this is a good way to improve efficiency. Most people see a doctor because they think they are sick, not because they are really sick. This situation leads to a lot of waste of medical resources.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Since humans tend to be biased, the algorithms that learn from them will also tend to be biased unless humans take extra care to find and remove the bias.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The ideal state is to eliminate all prejudices and protect everyone as much as possible. But prejudice comes from the individual. If you want prejudice, you need to change the individual.</p>
