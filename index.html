<h1>Project 01 Documentation</h1>
<p> This project is about emotional venting, using the characteristics of IFTTT. When users encounter unhappy things, they can immediately get comfort from friends, or digest these emotions by themselves.</p>


<h2>Week 01 Process</h2>

<p>This week we focus on breanstroming on what IFTTT can do and idea collect</p>
<p>First we brainstormed what interesting reactions and sources the Iftt technology can achieve. At the same time, idea collection was carried out, and finally we drew a simple diagram</p>

<p>User scenario: When a user browses to a message worth sharing, it will be sent to friends immediately via email. When a friend receives an e-mail, he will give feedback in two ways: "agree" or "disagree".</p>

<p>If you agree, the picture will be printed on your friend's printer. If you disagree, the picture will be printed on your printer. In this time of social distancing, this is a new way of communication and interaction.</p>
