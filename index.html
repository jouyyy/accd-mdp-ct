	<p style=" margin-top:10px;" > This project is about emotional venting, using the characteristics of IFTTT. When users encounter unhappy things, they can immediately get comfort from friends, or digest these emotions by themselves.</p>

	<h2>Week 01 Process</h2>
	<img src="001.jpeg" alt="yu1" width="1000" height="400">
	<p>This week we focus on breanstroming on what IFTTT can do and idea collect</p>
	<p>First we brainstormed what interesting reactions and sources the Iftt technology can achieve. At the same time, idea collection was carried out, and finally we drew a simple diagram</p>
	<img src="002.jpeg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="1000" height="400">
	<p>User scenario: When a user browses to a message worth sharing, it will be sent to friends immediately via email. When a friend receives an e-mail, he will give feedback in two ways: "agree" or "disagree".</p>
	<p>If you agree, the picture will be printed on your friend's printer. If you disagree, the picture will be printed on your printer. In this time of social distancing, this is a new way of communication and interaction.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Just like there is common agreement on the scientific nature of color today, it is also known that the human experience of color is a highly complex and subjective phenomenon.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I agree with this statement, because color needs to be pixel-accurate in the eyes of designers. Different colors have different meanings. For example, in our common sense, green is correct, and yellow is a warning color.</p>
	 <blockquote>
		<p>"There is a century-long bond between the field of design and new advances in technology, and if graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Because of the development of science and technology, the space for design has become larger and larger, and there are more and more tools that can be used. AR technology can also become less difficult, and designers can easily use tools to create.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“It is important to separate fact from fiction when discussing systematic design principles, and this is especially true for the subject of geometric composition.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I very much agree with this statement that the boundary between reality and virtuality needs to be delineated from the beginning. In this way, it can be designed for different scenarios.</p>

	<h2>Week 03 </h2>
	<p>Reading Response - You Look Like a Thing and I Love You </p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“The bias is still there, because the AI copied it from its training data, but now it’s wrapped in a layer of hard-to-interpret AI behavior.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Algorithm bias has been discussed many times. Before proceeding with algorithm design, I think that programmers need to achieve algorithm justice, solve from the root cause and eliminate the harm caused by the algorithm.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“AI was supposed to learn to identify pictures of skin cancer but learned to identify rulers instead”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Algorithm technology is widely used in medical treatment. From a macro perspective, this is a good way to improve efficiency. Most people see a doctor because they think they are sick, not because they are really sick. This situation leads to a lot of waste of medical resources.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Since humans tend to be biased, the algorithms that learn from them will also tend to be biased unless humans take extra care to find and remove the bias.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The ideal state is to eliminate all prejudices and protect everyone as much as possible. But prejudice comes from the individual. If you want prejudice, you need to change the individual.</p>

	<h2>Week 04 </h2>
	<p>Reading Response - Notes on Failure </p>
	

	<blockquote>
		<p>“n this, the art of reading hardly differs from the art of writing, in that its most intense pleasures and pains must remain private, and cannot be communicated to others. Our secret affinities remain secret even to ourselves… we fall in love with certain works of art, as we fall in love with certain individuals, for no very clear motive.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Discuss the criticism of emotions and how emotions control people's actions. It is strange that humans want to hide themselves and also want to expose themselves.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“If despair is-as I believe it to be-as absurd a state of the soul as euphoria, who can protest that it feels more substantial more reliable, less out of scale with the human environment-”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This sentence is about the end of the world, a beautiful orange.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“The idea that treatments had occurred without the explicit consent of Charlie’s users eroded trust in the system. In order to restore trust and provide opportunities for true consent, users demanded transparency”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This reminds me of the control of my own body. When a person is injured and enters the operating room, he is deprived of the right to control his body. Others can dispose of his body arbitrarily, and can even decide life and death.</p>

	<h2>Week 05 </h2>
	<p>Reading Response - Final Output of Diagram </p>
	

	<blockquote>
		<p>“A person in the system who makes a decision based on the feedback can’t change the behavior of the system that drove the current feedback; the decisions he or she makes will affect only future behavior.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This is also the basic principle of the system, when one of the triggers is activated, the other part can also be used.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Dynamic systems studies usually are not designed to predict what will happen. Rather, they’re designed to explore what would happen, if a number of driving factors unfold in a range of different ways.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I agree with this forecasting statement, from the initial forecast weather forecast. Up to now, it has been possible to predict every behavior when people wake up in the morning. It is a terrible prediction to predict the user's next actions based on every small action of the user.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called suboptimization”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When we design, we need to consider the front and back scenes, and consider the overall link and usage path.</p>

	<h2>Week 06 </h2>
	<p> Reading Response - Petri Dish & Chapter 3, Design as the Machines Come to Life from Synthetic Aesthtics </p>
	

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Humanity’s needs and consumer desires could be neatly balanced with our planet’s limited resources, as our machines come to life.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This is a very interesting point of view. The development of science and technology brings damage to the earth. The advancement of science and technology in Europe has caused the smog in London, which has caused many deaths.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“This use of “culture” harkens back to the cultivation of agriculture and animal husbandry of the 16th century, which was extended to the process of human development and eventually linked by philosophers, like Johann Gottfried Herder, to people marinating in particular conditions of place, language, spirit and tradition.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Humans cultivate in the utensils to cultivate more food and genetically modified crops. This is also a way for humans to control the ecology.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“If synthetic biology is truly a disruptive technology, then clinging to existing analogies of mechanical and electronic technology may hinder sustainable, ethical, and imaginative design, if that is what we seek”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Through synthesis, the desired creature can be obtained or the life more in line with human aesthetics can be cultivated. For example, pet cats are constantly cultivated for human desires.</p>

	<h2>Week 07 </h2>
	<p> Reading Response - Ruined By Design: How Designers Destroyed the World, and What We Can Do to Fix It </p>
	

	<blockquote>
		<p>“When all these amazing people, some of whom we don’t understand at all, go online, they are going to behave as inefficiently in there as they do out there. That is awesome.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The pursuit of efficiency by Internet designers is a normal state, or a special culture. In order to strive for the rapid launch of the product, the company requires designers to iterate the product quickly. And will this really make a good product?</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“When you are designing these platforms, you cannot put the onus of enforcing policies on your users.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Designers need to find ways to entice users to operate, and they should also give users the choice to refuse.</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>“A code of ethics will not magically transform us into people who behave decently. Its imposition, coming from the top, will have no transformative power. Only an agreement to follow it, made at the rank and file level, can change how we work”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When we find something unreasonable, we will make excuses for it because we can't solve it. In fact, we should have our own ideas. Everyone needs to fight for benefits, so that users will have the greatest benefits.</p>
